            <h2 id='heading'> Here's a time line of Constantin Brâncuși's life: </h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early years: </strong> Brâncuși grew up in the village of Hobiţa, Gorj, near Târgu Jiu, close to Romania's Carpathian Mountains, an area known for its rich tradition of folk crafts, particularly woodcarving. Geometric patterns of the region are seen in his later works. </li>
                <li><strong>Working in Paris: </strong> In 1903, Brâncuși traveled to Munich, and from there to Paris. In Paris, he was welcomed by the community of artists and intellectuals brimming with new ideas.[4] He worked for two years in the workshop of Antonin Mercié of the École des Beaux-Arts, and was invited to enter the workshop of Auguste Rodin.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal life: </strong> Brâncuși always dressed in the simple ways the Romanian peasants did. His studio was reminiscent of the houses of the peasants from his native region: there was a big slab of rock as a table and a primitive fireplace, similar to those found in traditional houses in his native Oltenia, while the rest of the furniture was made by him out of wood. Brâncuși would cook his own food, traditional Romanian dishes, with which he would treat his guests.</li>
                <li><strong>Death and legacy: </strong> Brâncuși died on March 16, 1957, aged 81. He was buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. This cemetery also displays statues that Brâncuși carved for deceased artists.</li>
                <li><strong>Art market: </strong> Brâncuși's piece Madame L.R. sold for €29.185 million ($37.2 million) in 2009, setting a record price for a sculpture sold at auction.</li>
                <li><strong>Brâncuși on his own work</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <em> "There are idiots who define my work as abstract; yet what they call abstract is what is most realistic. What is real is not the appearance, but the idea, the essence of things."</em></li>
                        <li> <em> "I ground matter to find the continuous line. And when I realized I could not find it, I stopped, as if an unseen someone had slapped my hands."</em></li>
                        <li> <em> "Work like a slave; command like a king; create like a god."</em></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Other works</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <em>Bust of a boy (1906) </em></li>
                        <li> <em>The Prayer (1907) </em></li>
                        <li> <em>La Sagesse de la Terre (1908) </em></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
